# 🛍️ AuraCart - Premium E-Commerce Platform

![AuraCart Preview](./AuraCart-frontend/public/images/aura-cart.png)

Welcome to **AuraCart**, a fully functional, premium e-commerce web application designed to deliver a modern and luxury shopping experience. This project serves as a showcase of modern frontend development, state management, and responsive design, built as part of my Project Showcasing Journey (Project 28 of 29).

## ✨ Features

- **Modern Luxury UI:** A visually stunning, monochrome and gold-themed design built with Tailwind CSS, utilizing glassmorphism and smooth micro-animations.
- **Dynamic Category Filtering:** Easily navigate between Men, Women, Kids, Home & Living, and Beauty sections using URL search parameters.
- **Real-Time Search:** Instantly find products with an integrated search bar that updates results dynamically.
- **Shopping Cart Management:** Add and remove items from your bag, with automatic calculations for total price, discounts, and convenience fees.
- **Robust State Management:** Powered by Redux Toolkit for efficient global state handling (shopping bag, items, and fetching status).
- **Resilient Data Fetching:** Seamless fallback to local mock data if the backend server is temporarily unavailable, ensuring a zero-downtime user experience.
- **Responsive Layout:** Fully optimized to look and work perfectly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend Integration:** Fully connect the frontend to a dynamic backend database (Node.js/Express & MongoDB) for live inventory management.
- **Payment Gateway:** Integrate Stripe or Razorpay to simulate the checkout process.
- **Wishlist Feature:** Allow users to save their favorite items for later without adding them to the cart.
